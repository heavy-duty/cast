# Behavior

The guarantees `cast apply` makes, the shapes it accepts, and the places
Coolify 4.1.2 does not cooperate. Extracted from the substrate repo this tool
was born in; the Coolify-source citations were verified against
`coollabsio/coolify` v4.1.2 and the vendored OpenAPI in `reference/`.


The command surface itself is in the README; this file is the behavior behind it.

**`dockercompose` build pack** (compose apps, box-B parity): a manifest
application whose `build.pack` is `dockercompose` declares
`build.compose_file` (path to the compose file in the checkout) and
`service_domains` (map of compose service name → `string[]` of URLs) instead
of the plain-app `port`/`healthcheck`/`domains` trio — those three live in the
compose file itself and are rejected by the manifest schema on a compose app;
conversely `service_domains`/`compose_file` are rejected on a non-compose app.
`domains` is schema-optional at the top level for this reason, but still
required (via a `superRefine`) for every non-compose app — no existing
manifest needs to change.

```yaml
core:
  source: { repo: acme/widget, branch: main }
  build: { pack: dockercompose, base_directory: /, compose_file: docker-compose.yaml }
  service_domains:
    api: ["https://api.widget.example.com"]
  env_template: core.prod.env.template
```

Internally cast keeps the map vocabulary (`docker_compose_domains:
{service: string[]}`) all the way through `resolve.ts`/`apply.ts`/diffing;
only `cli.ts`'s wire-translation layer (`applicationApiFields`) flattens it to
the Coolify request shape — an array of `{name, domain}` where `domain` is
that service's URLs comma-joined (verified against the
`/applications/private-github-app` and `PATCH /applications/{uuid}` request
schemas in `reference/coolify-openapi-4.1.2.json`). A compose app's create
payload also sets `connect_to_docker_network: true` — without it the stack
cannot reach the environment's managed Postgres/Redis resources at all, which
fails at runtime rather than at apply time.

Live-state projection (`projectLiveFields`) reads both fields back for a
compose app: `docker_compose_location` (a plain string on the GET model) and
`docker_compose_domains`, which the GET model documents as a nullable
**string**, not the structured array the write side accepts — parsed
defensively as JSON back into the internal map, degrading to "field omitted"
(not a crash) on anything that doesn't parse as a well-formed array of
`{name, domain}`. Projecting both is what keeps a matching re-apply a true
no-op instead of a spurious PATCH + stack redeploy every run. **This parsing
path is unverified against a real Coolify instance** — the read-back is only
confirmed by an overlay apply followed by an overlay-edit re-apply against a
live instance, which has not yet happened. If a live instance turns out not to expose
`docker_compose_domains` on read, apply's idempotency guarantee for the
domains half breaks and needs the same warn-and-drop treatment as service
domains below — that also removes the cutover mechanism (domains no longer
flip via re-apply), so it would need a runbook amendment, not a silent fix.

**Hostname overlay, compose apps:** `--hostname-overlay <file>` accepts a
per-service map value for a compose app's entry instead of the plain-app
`string[]`:

```yaml
core:
  api: ["http://api.<PROD-IP>.sslip.io"]
landing: ["http://landing.<PROD-IP>.sslip.io"]
```

Only the named services' domain lists are replaced; other services in the
same app keep their manifest values. A map value naming an unknown service
errors, listing the app's known services; a map value against a non-compose
app errors (`hostname overlay gave a service map for non-compose app <name>`)
— the plain `string[]` shape keeps working unchanged for non-compose apps.

**Structural vs. full diff** are tied to what the configured token can do,
not a flag alone: **structural** diff needs only a standing read-only token
and never compares env values (output says so explicitly); **full** diff
(and `apply`, which always requires full) needs a session token with
`read:sensitive` and compares secret values too — but the output only ever
says `secret FOO differs`, never the value on either side.

**Apply semantics** (verbatim from the spec's Global Constraints — never
softened by an implementation detail):

- Apply never deletes. Resource removal or rename is a manual runbook act;
  `diff` reports the orphan as such until that act happens.
- Apply never recreates a database resource under any circumstances.
- On drift in a field the API cannot update in place (`build_pack`, a
  database's `type`/`version`, a service's `type`), apply **fails loudly
  naming the field** rather than recreating.
- Apply ends every mutated resource with a restart/redeploy
  (`instant_deploy` on create, `/deploy` or `/restart` on update) — API
  mutations land in Coolify's DB, not in running containers, so a create or
  update that skipped this would silently not take effect.
- Direction is one-way, manifest → Coolify, always.
- **Environment guards:** `apply` refuses if a var matching that environment's
  `forbidden_var_patterns` is present in the resolved env **at all, regardless
  of value** — "off" means absent, not `false` (see the README). `apply` also
  refuses `--path` combined with `--env prod`: prod always reads the default
  branch, so a feature-branch checkout can never reach it.

**Known limitations, not defects:**

- **Backup schedules are create-time only.** A manifest database's `backup`
  block (`frequency`, `retention`) is applied only when the database is
  first created; it is deliberately kept out of the diffed `fields` (live
  Coolify state doesn't expose it back, so diffing it would flag spurious
  drift every run — breaking idempotency). Changing a schedule on an
  existing database is a runbook act, done by hand in the Coolify UI.
- **A service's `domains` cannot be applied via the API in Coolify 4.1.2,
  and is deliberately kept out of the diffed `fields` for the same
  idempotency reason as backup schedules above.** The `/services`
  create/update payload takes a structured per-container `urls` list, not
  the manifest's flat `domains: string[]`, and the manifest has no
  per-container name to build that list correctly from — so cast
  drops it rather than send a malformed payload. Live Coolify service state
  doesn't expose a flat `domains` back either, so if it stayed in `fields`
  every domain-bearing service would diff as a perpetual update and every
  `apply` would needlessly restart it — `desiredFromManifest` drops
  `domains` from the service's `fields` and **warns**
  (`service <name> declares domains (...), but apply cannot set them on
  Coolify 4.1.2 services — configure hostnames manually in the Coolify UI`)
  once per run for every service that declared any. Set service hostnames
  in the Coolify UI by hand.
- **The redis default image is an unverified extrapolation.** Coolify's
  "New Resource" wizard drives PostgreSQL version selection through a
  verified `postgres:<version>-alpine` image string; Redis has no version
  picker in that same wizard, so cast's `redis:<version>-alpine`
  guess for a manifest-declared `version` is the same Docker Hub tag
  convention applied by analogy, **not confirmed against a live Coolify
  instance**. Recommendation: leave a manifest database's `version` unset
  for `redis` until this has been verified once against bootstrap, letting
  Coolify pick its own default image instead of risking a bad tag.
